# Shopping-List

This project uses Java Swing and MySql to create a user database with a shopping list for each one.

To get started, you will need:

- Run "createDB.sql" (once);
- Change the strings "user" and "pasw" (located in "Main.java"), to their respective MySQL username and password;

Now you are able to use the code, just run "Main.java"

This program was initially a school project.
